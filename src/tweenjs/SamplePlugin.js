	 * A TweenJS plugin is simply an object that exposes one property (priority), and three methods (init, step, and tween).
	 * Generally a plugin will also expose an <code>install</code> method as well, though this is not strictly necessary.

	 * Called by TweenJS when a new property initializes on a tween. Generally, the call
	 * to <code>Plugin.init</code> will be immediately followed by a call to <code>Plugin.step</code>.

	 * 	foo.x = 0;
	 * 	foo.y = 100;
	 * 	
	 * 	Tween.get(foo)
	 * 		.to({x:10}) // init called with prop = "x", value = 0

	 * 		.to({y:200}) // init called with prop = "y", value = 100

	 * @method init
	 * @param {Tween} tween The related tween instance.
	 * @param {String} prop The name of the property that is being initialized.
	 * @param {any} value If another plugin has returned a starting value, it will be passed in. Otherwise value will be undefined.
	 * @return {any} The starting tween value for the property. In most cases, you would simply
	 * return the value parameter, but some plugins may need to modify the starting value. You can also return
	 * `Tween.IGNORE` to prevent this tween

		if (data && data.Sample_disabled) { return; }
		
		// filter which properties you want to work on by using "prop":
		if (prop !== "x" && prop !== "y") { return value; }

		// most plugins can just be a single shared plugin class:
		tween.addPlugin(SamplePlugin);

		// tween.addPlugin(new SamplePlugin());
		
		// note that it's also possible to create a plugin that doesn't add itself, but hooks into the "change" event instead.
		
		// you can grab the current value on the target using:
		var targetValue = tween.target[prop];
		
		// this would get the current starting value for the property, using value from previous plugins if specified, or the target value if not:
		// this is a bit of a pain, but it prevents accessing target values that aren't needed, which can be very expensive (ex. width on a HTMLElement, when we actually want to grab it from style)
		var defaultValue = (value === undefined) ? targetValue : value;
		
		// this would round the starting value of "x" properties:
		if (prop === "x") { return Math.round(defaultValue); }
		
		// this would tell the tween to not include the "y" property:
		// if (prop === "y") { return Tween.IGNORE }
		
		// you can also use pluginData to attach arbitrary data to the tween for later use:
		if (!data) { data = tween.pluginData = {}; } // to reduce GC churn, pluginData is null by default.
		data.Sample_foo = 200; // namespacing your values will help prevent conflicts
