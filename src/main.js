/**
 * The TweenJS JavaScript library provides a simple but powerful tweening interface. It supports tweening of both
 * numeric object properties & CSS style properties, and allows you to chain tweens and actions together to create
 * complex sequences.
 *
 * <h4>Simple Tween</h4>
 * This tween will tween the target's alpha property from 0 to 1 for 1s then call the <code>handleComplete</code> function.
 *
 * <code>
 *   target.alpha = 0;
 *   Tween.get(target)
 *     .to({ alpha: 1 }, 1000)
 *     .call(() => {
 *       // tween complete
 *     });
 * </code>
 *
 * <strong>Arguments and Scope</strong>
 * Tween also supports a `call()` with arguments and/or a scope. If no scope is passed, then the function is called
 * anonymously (normal JavaScript behaviour). The scope is useful for maintaining scope when doing object-oriented
 * style development.
 *
 * <code>
 *   Tween.get(target)
 *     .to({ alpha: 0 })
 *     .call(handleComplete, [argument1, argument2], this);
 * </code>
 *
 * <h4>Chainable Tween</h4>
 * This tween will wait 0.5s, tween the target's alpha property to 0 over 1s, set it's visible to false, then call the
 * <code>handleComplete</code> function.
 *
 * <code>
 *   target.alpha = 1;
 *   Tween.get(target)
 *     .wait(500)
 *     .to({ alpha: 0, visible : false }, 1000)
 *     .call(() => {
 *       // tween complete
 *     });
 * </code>
 *
 * <h4>Browser Support</h4>
 * TweenJS will work in all browsers.
 *
 * @namespace tweenjs
 *
 * @example
 * import { EventDispatcher, Event } from "@createjs/core";
 * const dispatcher = new EventDispatcher();
 * dispatcher.on("myEvent", foo);
 * dispatcher.dispatchEvent(new Event("myEvent"));
 * // foo() is called.

/**
 * README: Export Order
 *
 * Due to some classes having circular import bindings (whether at the top of the import chain or deeper in),
 * some exports here are in reverse order (such as Tween being exported before AbstractTween).
 * This is explained here: https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/845#issuecomment-240277194
